# Advent of Tiny

This year, I've decided to solve every day of AoC2024 in [Tiny](https://github.com/goodpaul6/Tiny).

The language is designed to have a _very small_ (< 5K LOC) compiler and runtime for embedding in other programs (kind of like Lua). However, it is statically typed and has fun features like compile-time metaprogramming (in C, though).

So far, this is proving to be an exercise in restraint (*do not add 500 features to the language in order to write AoC solutions*) and also a lesson in just how useful standard data structures are.
